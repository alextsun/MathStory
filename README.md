This is a game I wrote during high school for my final project.  It is a simulation of the popular game MapleStory.  There was a required educational aspect - therefore, to attack, you must answer a simple math question (arithmetic).  You can choose between a magician (recommended) or warrior.  Run the game using Game.java.
